A little map dev/mod dev utility to help people check for duped items.

# Item NBT
To see an Item NBT tag just activate the advanced tooltips by pressing F3+H.
There you can check the item's UUID, that can be used to check if an item is duped.
In addition, the mod also highlights duped items in black, and adds lore to the item making it very clear
the item is in fact duped, as shown in the imagine below.
